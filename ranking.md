__Relative to b2, which would contribute the least to overall benefit failure. How much could b1 contribute to overall benefit failure if it was not realised?__

- [ ] contribute equally as b2 (1)
- [ ] contribute slightly more than b2 (2)
- [ ] contribute somewhat more then b2 (3)
- [ ] contribute notably more then b2 (4)
- [ ] contribute much more then b2 (5)
- [ ] contribute very much more then b2 (6)
- [ ] contribute extremely very much more to overall failure then b2 (7)
- [x] contribute _______ more to overall failure then b2 (8)

- [ ] absolutely contribute immeasurably more than b2 but less than b3 (9)
- [ ] b1 contribution to benefit failure is equal to that of b3
